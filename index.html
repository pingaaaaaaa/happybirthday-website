            <p><i> Hi,... ·É¶<br> Surpriseee!!! I just made my first-ever website.. just to celebrate your birthday hehe.<br> Turning to 17 years old, I wish you always be healthy, eat and grow fast; always focus on achieving your goals, be perserved, determined and happy. I know that you have been trying your best so so much.
            Remember Ho Ngoc Vy, you have made it so far and your family, friends, me always proud of you. Don't underestimate your self, success is something that happens after a long voyage, don't worry if you made mistakes, fail or perhaps lost your hopes in something...<br> All I want to tell is that keep going and don't give up buddy, successful person is the one that has a thousand time being called as failure but he/she never surrenders!!
            There are many things on my mind right now, as I write this code, but I don't think I'll be able to say it all here.</i></p>
            <p> <i>I'm glad that I could meet you, and be your friend. I could say that you are the same version of me when I was in secondary school, but you're a better vers one. Cuz you have people who love you and support you all the ways... including pin.
                Maybe something I'm in a bad mood, I don't mean to hurt you, but yep, I could use silent treatment... But remeber it just appears for while, so don't give a fuck about it muahehehe.
                Bro I'm running out of ideas. I do think of creating HPBD templates for you, but I think this is a way much better and professional and ethical.This web may be not as perfect as you imaged when i said i learnt how to codecode, but yeah my first time so I will try to do something great later for you to play. Promise!</i>
            </p>
            <p id="excep"><b> ü§çAlways remember that I got your back and I'm here to support or maybe listen toü§ç <br> you when you need - my exception along with my fam.</b></p>
            <h3 id="hey"> Last words: HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOU DUCK DUCK, WISH YOU A DAY FILLED WITH JOY AND HAPPINESS
                 TURNING 17 YOLO!! Best wishes!!
